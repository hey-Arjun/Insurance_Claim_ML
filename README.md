# 🏥 Insurance Premium Predictor (FastAPI + Random Forest)
A production-ready Insurance Premium Prediction system built using Random Forest (scikit-learn) with a FastAPI backend for real-time inference.
The project performs end-to-end prediction by:
Validating user inputs with Pydantic
Engineering features such as BMI, age group, lifestyle risk, and city tier
Encoding categorical variables using a scikit-learn pipeline
Serving predictions through a RESTful FastAPI API
The application is fully deployable and demonstrates:
Clean ML pipeline design with ColumnTransformer and RandomForestClassifier
Robust request validation and preprocessing
Scalable API-based model inference
Ready-to-use deployment setup for cloud or local environments
Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, Random Forest, FastAPI, Pandas, NumPy
Use Case: Insurance risk categorization & premium prediction
